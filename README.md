# Book Recommendattion System

[Project Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19GBtfs6kTlUtsR0LNXV0G8bfYShZO9Eg/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101611360201381860934&rtpof=true&sd=true) - This report presents a comprehensive Book Recommendation System that uses
collaborative filtering and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithms to create a robust data model. The system uses Python and libraries like Streamlit, Pickle, and NumPy to provide personalized
book recommendations based on user preferences. Also also discusses the intricacies of algorithm selection, model training, and system design, highlighting the importance of good
design principles and user experience considerations in creating an intuitive interface.

## KNN Algorithm

The system employs a k-nearest neighbors algorithm to find similar books based on user preferences and provides an interactive and visually appealing way for users to discover
new books. the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) method is used by the book recommendation system to deliver customers customized recommendations based on input book names and
comparable ratings from a preprocessed dataset. Preprocessing the dataset is a critical step in improving the quality of recommendations. Through the use of
KNN, the collaborative filtering strategy promotes a user-centric experience by taking
comparable readers' preferences into account. The project's future scope has enormous room for growth and development. Initially, it is imperative to tackle the substantial computational expense linked to the NxN
matrix utilized in the K-Nearest Neighbors technique.

## Web Application

It loads a pre-trained collaborative filtering model along with necessary data artifacts, allowing users to select a book from a dropdown menu and receivepersonalized book recommendations. An easy-to-use interface is guaranteed by
the front-end's smooth integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as Python's Streamlit framework. The system's strength is its ability to use KNN for efficient similarity
matching, which makes book recommendations relevant and accurate. 
Strong algorithms combined with a simplified front-end demonstrate how backend features and user interaction work together. All things considered, the book recommendation
system is a powerful example of how machine learning and web development can work together to provide personalized reading recommendations for readers.
